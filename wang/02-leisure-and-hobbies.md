I'm a big <mark style="color:red;">shutterbug</mark>. I carry my digital camera wherever I go. I love taking photos of **landscapes** and <mark style="color:red;">portraits</mark> of my friends. For me the best part of photography is to capture a moment that would otherwise be lost forever. But <mark style="color:red;">selfies</mark> are not really my thing, I guess I'm not very **photogenic**.
