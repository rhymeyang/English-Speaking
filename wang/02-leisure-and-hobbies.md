In fact, I've just **taken up** the piano after I went to a gig by an upcoming musician who really inspired me. She writes her own music and is so **talented**.

It's common to see a bunch of **grannies** dancing to **blasting** music in public squares. For the participants this is a popular **form of exercise** but for some young people it's sometimes a **nuisance**.

### Art

**Art/Photography**

I'm quite **into** art, I mean I enjoy looking at beautiful pictures on Instagram and Pinterest. But going to the exhibitions, I can **take it or leave it**. I believe you find art everywhere if you pay attention.

I'm a big shutterbug. I carry my digital camera wherever I go. I love taking photos of **landscapes** and portraits of my friends. For me the best part of photography is to capture a moment that would otherwise be lost forever. But selfies are not really my thing, I guess I'm not very **photogenic**.

* scenery 不可数

**Reading**

My high school English teacher really **instilled in me the love of** books and to appreciate all types, including **Shakespere, poetry, biographies and a autobiographies**, instead of the easy-reading type of books such as **fiction** and **love stories**.

* instill someone sth.
* a page turner 好看的书

4. Do you prefer to take photos of others or to be taken photos of?
